    <!-- 2.1 Student Conduct and Professional Behavior -->
    <article class="subsection" id="student-conduct">
      <h3>2.1 Student Conduct and Professional Behavior</h3>
      <p>Shajid Royal College of Nursing and Midwifery is committed to the development of future healthcare professionals who embody the values of compassion, discipline, accountability, and integrity. As a professional training institution governed by the standards of the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN), the College holds all students to a high standard of personal and professional conduct, both on campus and in clinical settings.</p>
      <p>Upon enrollment, students become representatives of both the College and the nursing profession at large. As such, their behavior must reflect the ethical expectations of healthcare providers. All students are expected to demonstrate respect for their peers, faculty, patients, clinical supervisors, and institutional policies.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples of Expected Professional Conduct:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular and punctual attendance in lectures, skills labs, and clinical assignments</li>
        <li>Polite and respectful communication with instructors, administrators, peers, and clients</li>
        <li>Compliance with established clinical guidelines, hospital protocols, and college rules</li>
        <li>Maintenance of confidentiality regarding patient care and sensitive health records</li>
        <li>Upholding personal hygiene, modest dressing, and professional appearance</li>
        <li>Demonstration of honesty in coursework, examinations, and clinical documentation</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Unprofessional Conduct May Include (but is not limited to):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cheating during examinations or forging clinical logbooks</li>
        <li>Verbal abuse, threats, fighting, or insubordination</li>
        <li>Absenteeism or tardiness without formal excuse</li>
        <li>Possession or use of drugs, alcohol, or weapons on campus or at clinical sites</li>
        <li>Disrespect toward patients, staff, or fellow students</li>
        <li>Posting defamatory or offensive content about the College on social media</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Misconduct will be investigated through formal procedures outlined by the Student Disciplinary Committee. Sanctions may include a written warning, suspension, academic probation, or expulsion depending on severity. Appeals may be submitted in writing within 7 working days of any disciplinary action.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- 2.2 Attendance and Participation Requirements -->
    <article class="subsection" id="attendance">
      <h3>2.2 Attendance and Participation Requirements</h3>
      <p>Attendance and punctuality are fundamental components of nursing and midwifery education. At Shajid Royal College, students are expected to engage fully in both classroom instruction and clinical practice.</p>
      <p><strong>Classroom Attendance:</strong> A minimum of 75% attendance is required for all academic sessions. Late arrivals may be marked partially or fully absent. Failure to meet this threshold results in ineligibility for final exams.</p>
      <p><strong>Clinical Attendance:</strong> Students must complete 100% of clinical hours. Any missed hours must be rescheduled and formally approved. Excused absences must be documented (e.g., medical certificate).</p>
      <p><strong>Participation:</strong> Students are expected to actively participate in discussions, presentations, group work, and clinical practice. Passive attendance may affect participation grades and academic standing.</p>
      <p><strong>Excused Absences:</strong> These may be granted for health issues, family emergencies, religious observances, or official school activities—provided that formal documentation is submitted within 48 hours of return.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- 2.3 Grading System and Academic Progression -->
    <article class="subsection" id="grading">
      <h3>2.3 Grading System and Academic Progression</h3>
      <p>Academic performance is measured using a combination of Continuous Assessments and End-of-Semester Examinations. Clinical placements are assessed via logbooks, supervisor feedback, and standardized evaluations.</p>
      <p><strong>Grading Scale:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A: 70–100% – Excellent</li>
        <li>B: 60–69% – Very Good</li>
        <li>C: 50–59% – Satisfactory</li>
        <li>F: Below 50% – Fail</li>
        <li>I: Incomplete</li>
        <li>W: Withdrawn</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Assessment Weights:</strong> Continuous Assessment – 40%; Final Exam – 60%</p>
      <p><strong>Progression:</strong> Students must pass all academic and clinical components and meet attendance and financial obligations. Failures must be repeated in the next cycle, and students on academic probation must show improvement to avoid withdrawal.</p>

    <h2>Section 3: Clinical Experience and Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Clinical education is the heart of nursing and midwifery training. It provides students with hands-on experience, allowing them to integrate theory with practice in real-world healthcare environments. At Shajid Royal College of Nursing and Midwifery, clinical experience is structured, progressive, and supervised, ensuring students build competence, confidence, and ethical sensitivity in patient care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The College partners with government and private hospitals, primary healthcare centers, psychiatric facilities, maternity clinics, and community health programs to offer comprehensive clinical exposure across the lifespan—from neonates to geriatrics.
    </p>

    <h3 id="section3-1">3.1 Overview of Clinical Training Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      The College adopts a Competency-Based Clinical Education (CBCE) model, aligned with NMCN’s standards and WHO recommendations. This model emphasizes the demonstration of knowledge, skill, and judgment in real-time clinical scenarios.
    </p>
    <ol class="shajid-list">
      <li>Translate classroom learning into patient-centered care.</li>
      <li>Develop technical and interpersonal skills required in nursing and midwifery.</li>
      <li>Promote decision-making, communication, and documentation practices.</li>
      <li>Foster empathy, ethics, and cultural competence in all care settings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Students are introduced to clinical practice early in the program and progress from observation to direct care under supervision. Clinical hours are strictly tracked and must be completed in accordance with national curriculum requirements.
    </p>

    <h3 id="section3-2">3.2 Clinical Placement Process and Supervision</h3>
    <p>
      The Clinical Coordinator is responsible for the planning, scheduling, and monitoring of all clinical postings. Students are assigned to accredited institutions based on level of training, program requirements, and departmental availability.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Placement Process:</strong></p>
    <ol class="shajid-list">
      <li>Clinical schedules are released at the beginning of each semester.</li>
      <li>Students are issued posting letters, which must be presented to the host facility.</li>
      <li>Each student is attached to a clinical preceptor or ward nurse for supervision.</li>
      <li>Weekly and end-of-posting evaluations are conducted by both College faculty and hospital staff.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Students are required to:</strong></p>
    <ol class="shajid-list">
      <li>Report to duty on time, in full uniform, and with their logbook.</li>
      <li>Observe hospital protocol, chain of command, and infection control procedures.</li>
      <li>Perform nursing interventions appropriate to their level of training.</li>
      <li>Record daily activities in the Clinical Logbook, which must be countersigned by a supervisor.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Failure to report for clinical duty without valid excuse is treated as a serious academic and ethical violation.
    </p>

    <h3 id="section3-3">3.3 Health Clearance and Immunization Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      To protect both students and the clients they serve, the College mandates a complete pre-clinical health screening before students are cleared to participate in any patient care activity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Required Medical Tests:</strong></p>
    <ol class="shajid-list">
      <li>Hepatitis B screening and vaccination (mandatory)</li>
      <li>Tuberculosis (Mantoux or Chest X-ray)</li>
      <li>HIV testing (voluntary, confidential)</li>
      <li>Typhoid and Tetanus vaccination</li>
      <li>Full physical examination</li>
      <li>Blood group and genotype</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A Medical Fitness Certificate from the College-approved hospital must be submitted to the Medical Unit before beginning the first clinical posting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students are expected to maintain their health and report any infectious illness, injury, or condition that may compromise patient safety. Pregnant students are encouraged to notify the Clinical Office for appropriate assignment modifications, especially in maternity and theatre units.
    </p>

    <h3 id="section3-4">3.4 Uniform, Identification, and Personal Grooming Standards</h3>
    <p>
      Uniforms are an essential part of clinical professionalism. All students must adhere to the approved uniform code during clinical rotations and practical demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Uniform Guidelines:</strong></p>
    <ol class="shajid-list">
      <li><strong>General Nursing:</strong> White tunic with College badge and name tag, navy blue skirt or trousers, white closed shoes, nurse’s cap (female) or neat haircut (male).</li>
      <li><strong>Midwifery:</strong> Peach/lavender tunic, white skirt/trousers, white shoes, midwife’s cap with appropriate band.</li>
      <li><strong>Psychiatric Nursing:</strong> Light grey tunic, dark green skirt/trousers, minimal jewelry, flat shoes.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>
      Any student found in non-compliance may be asked to leave the clinical area and reported for disciplinary action.
    </p>

    <h3 id="section3-5">3.5 Clinical Attendance and Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      100% attendance is required for all clinical postings unless excused for valid reasons. Punctuality and presence reflect the values of trust and responsibility inherent in healthcare.

    <p><strong>Excused Absences:</strong> Certified illness, bereavement, civic/legal duty. Documentation is required.</p>
